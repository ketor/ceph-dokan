/**
 * @defgroup librados_h_snaps Snapshots
 *
 * RADOS snapshots are based upon sequence numbers that form a
 * snapshot context. They are pool-specific. The snapshot context
 * consists of the current snapshot sequence number for a pool, and an
 * array of sequence numbers at which snapshots were taken, in
 * descending order. Whenever a snapshot is created or deleted, the
 * snapshot sequence number for the pool is increased. To add a new
 * snapshot, the new snapshot sequence number must be increased and
 * added to the snapshot context.
 *
 * There are two ways to manage these snapshot contexts:
 * -# within the RADOS cluster
 *    These are called pool snapshots, and store the snapshot context
 *    in the OSDMap. These represent a snapshot of all the objects in
 *    a pool.
 * -# within the RADOS clients
 *    These are called self-managed snapshots, and push the
 *    responsibility for keeping track of the snapshot context to the
 *    clients. For every write, the client must send the snapshot
 *    context. In librados, this is accomplished with
 *    rados_selfmanaged_snap_set_write_ctx(). These are more
 *    difficult to manage, but are restricted to specific objects
 *    instead of applying to an entire pool.
