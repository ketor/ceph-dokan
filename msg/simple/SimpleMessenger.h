/*
 * This class handles transmission and reception of messages. Generally
 * speaking, there are several major components:
 *
 * - Connection
 *    Each logical session is associated with a Connection.
 * - Pipe
 *    Each network connection is handled through a pipe, which handles
 *    the input and output of each message.  There is normally a 1:1
 *    relationship between Pipe and Connection, but logical sessions may
 *    get handed off between Pipes when sockets reconnect or during
 *    connection races.
 * - IncomingQueue
 *    Incoming messages are associated with an IncomingQueue, and there
 *    is one such queue associated with each Pipe.
 * - DispatchQueue
 *    IncomingQueues get queued in the DIspatchQueue, which is responsible
 *    for doing a round-robin sweep and processing them via a worker thread.
 * - SimpleMessenger
 *    It's the exterior class passed to the external message handler and
 *    most of the API details.
 *
 * Lock ordering:
 *
 *   SimpleMessenger::lock
 *       Pipe::pipe_lock
 *           DispatchQueue::lock
 *               IncomingQueue::lock
